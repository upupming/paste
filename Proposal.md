# A Proposal to Research the Possible Applications of Computer Vision 

## Introduction

Computer vision deals how computer can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images and videos. In the last few decades, Computer vision has developed a lot, and we can see many applications of it in our real life, such as face recognition, Image search and remote sensing. However, there are more situations where we need this kind of technology to reduce human labor, or help get information more  conveniently. This document proposes a research what situations are suitable for computer vision and how we can apply computer vision technology to the situations. This proposal includes my methods of gathering information, a schedule for completing the research, and my qualifications.

## Statement of Problem

In many fields, people are doing things which possibly can be done by computer vision. For example, people counter in public places are alternatives for ourselves, and its accuracy may be higher than human.  Another example is that when I went to our library, the face recognition machine always fail to recognize me until several trails. In my everyday life, the images search engine help a lot when I doesn't have a knowledge on a new thing. The picture-to-text converter also helps many people release their time on typing.

All these things happened around us give us a inspiration: If we take the best adventure of computer vision, things will be different.

Some companies and research organizations have develop their technology for their usage. NASA's Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission is an ongoing robotic space mission involving two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, exploring the planet Mars, it has stereo cameras mounted on the top of the rover for space exploration.

## Objectives

I propose to research the available scholar articles about applications of computer vision. In this research I will achieve the following two goals:

(1) explain the principle of the computer vision, and its current usage;
(2) determine whether the technology can be applied to our daily life and how to achieve it.

## Plan of Action

This section presents my plan for obtaining the objectives discussed in the previous section. There has been an increase of interest in the computer science industry concerning the computer vision because of
